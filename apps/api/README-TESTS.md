# API Tests Implementation

This document provides an overview of the test implementation for the API project.

## Overview

The API project now has comprehensive test coverage for its endpoints:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing the controllers in isolation
2. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing the API endpoints through HTTP requests

## Test Files Created

### Unit Tests

- `src/app.controller.spec.ts`: Tests for the root endpoint controller
- `src/auth/auth.controller.spec.ts`: Tests for the authentication controller
- `src/pages/pages.service.spec.ts`: Tests for the pages service
- `src/pages/pages.controller.spec.ts`: Tests for the pages controller

### End-to-End Tests

- `test/app.e2e-spec.ts`: E2E tests for the root endpoint
- `test/auth.e2e-spec.ts`: E2E tests for the authentication endpoints
- `test/jest-e2e.json`: Configuration for E2E tests
- `test/README.md`: Documentation for the tests

## Test Coverage

The tests cover the following endpoints:

- `GET /`: The root endpoint
- `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login`: Login a user
- `GET /auth/profile`: Get the authenticated user's profile
- `POST /pages`: Create a new page
- `GET /pages`: Get all pages for the authenticated user
- `GET /pages/:id`: Get a specific page by ID
- `PUT /pages/:id`: Update a specific page by ID
- `DELETE /pages/:id`: Delete a specific page by ID

For each endpoint, the tests cover:

- Success scenarios
- Error scenarios (validation errors, authentication errors)
- Edge cases

## Running the Tests

### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm test
```

### End-to-End Tests

To run the end-to-end tests:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm test:e2e
```

### Test Coverage

To run the tests with coverage:

```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm test:cov
```

## Mocking Strategy

The tests use mocks to avoid actual database operations:

- Unit tests mock the services that the controllers depend on
- End-to-end tests mock the database operations to avoid actual database interactions

This ensures that the tests are fast, reliable, and don't depend on external services.

## Next Steps

To further improve the test coverage:

1. Add tests for any new endpoints that are added to the API
2. Add more edge cases and error scenarios
3. Consider adding integration tests that test the interaction between components
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to run the tests automatically

## Conclusion

The API project now has a solid foundation of tests that verify the functionality of its endpoints. These tests will help ensure that the API works correctly and that changes don't break existing functionality.
